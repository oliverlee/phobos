 * Simplified equations of motion are used to simulate the bicycle dynamics.
 * Roll/steer rate and acceleration terms are ignored resulting in:
 *      (g*K0 + v^2*K2) [phi  ] = [T_phi  ]
 *                      [delta] = [T_delta]
 *
 * As T_phi is zero, roll (phi) is dependent on steer (delta). Steer torque can
 * be determined solely from steer angle.
 *
 * The equation of motion governing the *physical* steering assembly is:
 *      I_delta * delta_dd = T_delta + T_m
 *
 * where I_delta is the moment of inertia of the physical steering assembly about the steer axis
 *       delta_dd is the steer angular acceleration determined from the bicycle model
 *       T_delta is the steer torque
 *       T_m is the feedback torque
 *
 * In this case, delta_dd is set to zero as well to simplify calculations resulting in:
 *      T_m = -T_delta

 *     [delta_dd]        [delta_d]     [delta] = [T_delta]
 * where v*C1 is used to distinguish the "damping" matrix from the state
 * space output matrix C. In this simulation, T_phi defined to be 0 as there
 * is no way for the user nor the environment to supply a roll torque.
 *
 * The dynamics of the handlebar are governed by the following equation of
 * motion:
 *  I_delta * delta_dd = T_delta + T_m.
 *
 * Note: Positive torque and steer angle is clockwise as seen from the rider
 * looking down at the handlebars.
 *
 * In standard state space form, the equations of motion for the system are:
 *  [phi_d   ] = A [phi    ] + B [T_phi]
 *  [delta_d ]     [delta  ]     [T_delta]
 *  [phi_dd  ]     [phi_d  ]
 *  [delta_dd]     [delta_d]
 *
 * As we need an estimate of the steer angle acceleration, we use the last row
 * of A and B _with_ the assumption that the full state is available. As the
 * state vector is appended with yaw angle in this implementation, this must be
 * accounted for when calculating delta_dd.
 *
 * The output of this function is very susceptible to error/noise in the
 * state or noise in the input. For use with equipment, it is suggested to
 * filter the returned value.
